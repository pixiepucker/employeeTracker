# Employee Tracker: Challenge 12

## Description
For this week's challenge, we were to build a CMS or a content management system for a business owner. This would include looking at departments, employees with their roles and salaries, etc. I would do this by using Inquirer to build my command-line interface with prompts and mySQL to store information in databases that reference each other. This project is incomplete so the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56ahSLQ6Nes) will only show the files I have.

### Further Development 
With the help of my team, I will complete this challenge in order to showcase the skills I've learned over the past 15 weeks. I plan to get this application up and running before graduation in June 2022. My command-line app will allow the business user to view all departments, roles, and employees so that they can better organize their company.

Installation, Usage, and Tests Sections will be added as the project moves forward.
